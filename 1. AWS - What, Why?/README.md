### 1. AWS - What, Why? 
#### What is Amazon Web Services? 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a complete cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. It provides a wide range of services, including compute, storage, databases, machine learning, networks, etc. over the internet with a pay-as-you-go model. 

AWS enables individuals, businesses, and governments to access reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure without the need to own or manage physical servers.

### Why Learn AWS?

AWS is the most widely adopted cloud platform in the world. Learning AWS offers several benefits:

- **In-demand skill**: Cloud computing is essential in modern IT, and AWS is a market leader.
- **Global reach**: AWS serves customers in more than 190 countries.
- **Career opportunities**: AWS skills are relevant across many roles including developer, architect, operations, and data roles.
- **Foundational knowledge**: Understanding AWS concepts helps with learning other cloud platforms (Azure, GCP).

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (the cloud). It allows users to avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining IT infrastructure.

### Types of Cloud Computing:

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual servers and networking (e.g., Amazon EC2)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Managed platforms for deploying applications (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Fully managed applications (e.g., AWS WorkSpaces)

### Cloud Deployment Models:

- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet (e.g., AWS)
- **Private Cloud**: Services maintained on a private network
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds

---

### AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS operates across multiple physical locations globally:

- **Regions**: Separate geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Isolated data centers within a region
- **Edge Locations**: Used for content delivery (via Amazon CloudFront)
